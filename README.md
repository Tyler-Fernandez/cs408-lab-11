Date: November 4, 2025

## Overview

This project is a simple inventory app where you can add items to a database with their ID, Name, and Price.
It then loads onto the table, where the user can delete items from the database.
The button at the top loads all items from the database.

## How To Run

Clone the repository onto your local computer within an IDE of choosing, preferably VS Code. Download and use the Live Preview extension and open the preview using the button in the top right of the screen.
